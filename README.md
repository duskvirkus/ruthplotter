# Ruth Plotter

A collection of code for my first plotter named after Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It was made using cheap xy plotter kit which was heavily modified using an arduino, adafruit motor shield v2, mechanical limit switches, and some 3d prints. I doubt that anyone will be able to use this code out of the box but I hope making it open source will help others in working on similar projects.

## Documentation

Ruth Plotter uses the open plot standard that I developed. More information on it is available at [https://github.com/violetcraze/openplot](https://github.com/violetcraze/openplot).
